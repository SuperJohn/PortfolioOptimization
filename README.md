# Portfolio Optimization

A demo version of a Shiny Application created for a private client in the financial space. Removed some proprietary functionality to publish publically.

The app performs financial portfolio optimization, backtesting, and rebalancing based on a narrow strategy, but can be easily customized for alternative strategies and goals.
